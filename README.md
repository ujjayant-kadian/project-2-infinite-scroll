# project-2-infinite-scroll
This is my second project using asynchronous functions. Learned two new eventlisteners - load and scroll.

Created a website that constantly fetches images from UNSPLASH API and displays it on the
webpage. It allows users to scroll indefinitely, showing different images at each scroll, like social
media applications.
